        <h2>What is Footmatch?</h2>
        <p>
            Footmatch allows you to search for the single ticket by entering the team name, match date, and competition round number.
            Alternatively, you can search for available tickets for a single team, tickets available for all teams on a single date,
            or view tickets for a single round of competitions. By default, the web app shows the ten matches closest to today's date.
